# Novel Write

Use this skill when the user wants to write the next chapter from the current outline and project state.

## Inputs

- `chapter`
- optional `word_count`
- optional `style`

## Preconditions

- `.mighty/state.json` exists
- `大纲/章纲/第N章.md` exists for the target chapter
- `设定集/角色/主角.md` exists
- Shared assets exist:
  - `../../shared/profiles/`
  - `../../shared/references/`
- If this is not chapter 1, either the previous chapter file or a valid prior summary exists

## Required reads

Always read:

- `.mighty/state.json`
- `大纲/章纲/第N章.md`
- `设定集/角色/主角.md`

Read conditionally:

- `大纲/总纲.md` for main-arc alignment
- relevant `设定集/世界观/*.md`
- relevant supporting character files in `设定集/角色/`
- previous chapter file or summary

## Workflow

1. Read `.mighty/state.json`.
2. Read the target chapter outline from `大纲/章纲/第N章.md`.
3. Read required setting files from `设定集/`.
4. Load the shared profile matching the project genre from `../../shared/profiles/`.
5. Load high-value shared references from `../../shared/references/` only as needed.
6. If a previous chapter exists, read the prior chapter summary or chapter file for continuity.
7. Write `chapters/第N章.md` aligned to:
   - current state
   - target chapter outline
   - genre/platform expectations
8. Update `.mighty/state.json` with:
   - `progress.current_chapter`
   - `progress.total_words`
   - `progress.last_write_chapter`
   - `progress.last_write_time`
   - `chapter_meta`
   - `chapter_snapshots`
   - `summaries_index`
9. Do not write review scores here unless an actual review step was run.
10. Recommend running `novel-review` immediately after writing.

## Chapter state update requirements

At minimum, update:

- `chapter_meta[chapter]`
- `chapter_snapshots[chapter]`
- `summaries_index[chapter]`
- `entities.characters.protagonist` if the chapter changes protagonist state
- `plot_threads` if foreshadowing or suspense changes

## Outputs

- `chapters/第N章.md`
- updated `.mighty/state.json`
- optional note recommending `novel-review`

## Failure handling

- If `.mighty/state.json` is missing, stop and route back to `novel-init`.
- If the target chapter outline is missing, stop and route back to `novel-outline`.
- If continuity-critical state is ambiguous, prefer using the existing state file over guessing from prose.
- Do not invent new top-level state sections unless strictly required.

## Notes

- Keep writing aligned to the outline and current state.
- Do not invent structural state fields ad hoc; prefer extending the existing `.mighty/state.json` shape conservatively.
